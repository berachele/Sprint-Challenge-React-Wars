State is when you have a current *state* that is going to be changed somehow. This is so that we can loop through data and show different options and keep our code DRY

  Props is properties that allows you to use different data from parent js files on child folders so you don't have to repeat code

- [ ] What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

  side effects are what's used for when changes are made on the Dom (such as a button is clicked, etc.), the page is refreshed so that it can do that command. you sunc effects with useEffect method so it happens only when then change occurs. You sync them by putting what specific data you want in the [] after the useEffect. (Such as [breed] to loop through all the dog breed data)
